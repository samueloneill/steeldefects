# Development of a machine learning model for classifying steel plate defects
This Python script is an investigation into the best machine-learning classification algorithm to use in a condition-based maintenance system for steel plates, as well as the generation of the resulting random forest model. The finalised model was capable of predicting the category of defect on a steel plate with 78% accuracy.

# Report
A PDF report into the findings of the investigation is also included. This includes initial research into the problem as well as a detailed breakdown of the Python script.

# What I Learned
  - Core concepts of several common machine-learning algorithms
  - Using Python to generate a machine-learning model
  - Using Python to test, compare and fine tune models
